# Rust Exercises

# Overview

This repository is home to the work I have done while learning the
Rust programming language. All of the exercises I have done so far
have come from a single book: *The Rust Programming Language*, also
known simply as the Rust book. I have completed several chapters worth
of exercises, and I am still working through the book. My goal is to
understand Rust's design decisions, what differentiates it from
languages like C, and how to write clean, efficient code.

# *The Rust Programming Language*

My exercises from this book are in `rust-programming-language`. Within
that directory, there is a `chapters` directory, which is for working
with code given as part of the book's chapters. The other directory
within is `exercises`, which is where I have been completing all of
the end of chapter exercises.

# *Programming Rust*

I have not started on this book from O'Reilly, but it is the next one
I will read after the Rust book. I hope that it will offer additional
perspective and understanding on Rust.
